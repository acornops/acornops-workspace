# Conventional Commits

AcornOps repositories use Conventional Commits 1.0.0 for commit subjects and
pull request titles.

Reference: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

## Required Format

```text
type(scope): summary
type: summary
type(scope)!: summary
type!: summary
```

The subject must start with a type, may include a scope, may include `!` for a
breaking change, and must use `: ` before the summary.

Examples:

```text
feat(control-plane): add job retry policy
fix(gateway): preserve streaming error metadata
docs(workspace): clarify developer setup
ci: validate conventional PR titles
```

Breaking changes must be marked with `!` in the subject or with a
`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

## Default Types

Use these types unless a repository documents an additional type:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `docs`
- `refactor`
- `test`
- `chore`
- `ci`
- `build`
- `perf`
- `style`
- `revert`

## Enforcement

The workspace provides `scripts/harness/check-conventional-commits.mjs` for
commit-message and PR-title validation. The root workspace CI validates pull
request titles and pushed commit messages with this script.

Child repositories should adopt the same rule in their local CI or commit
workflow. Existing historical commits are not rewritten; enforcement applies to
new commits and pull requests.
