# Harness Adoption Guide

This guide explains how AcornOps repositories should adopt shared harness
standards without losing repository-specific ownership.

## Model

AcornOps uses three layers:

1. Workspace harness: the parent `acornops` repository.
2. Repo-local harness: each standalone GitHub repository.
3. Platform harness: deployment/integration repository.

The underlying agent-harness rationale is captured in
[`openai-harness-engineering.md`](openai-harness-engineering.md), which maps
OpenAI Codex-style repo navigation, editing, command execution, and test
execution into AcornOps repo-local validation rules.

## Repo-local harness

Each product repository should commit its own:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
- `docs/DESIGN.md`
- `docs/PLANS.md`
- `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md`
- `docs/RELIABILITY.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`
- `docs/contracts/README.md`
- `docs/contracts/manifest.json`
- `scripts/check-harness.*`
- `scripts/check-contracts.*`
- one canonical validation command

The repository-local files are authoritative for that repository. Shared
templates provide structure only.

For whole-system topology, use one canonical owner instead of duplicating large
diagrams in every repo. In AcornOps, that owner is
`docs/system-architecture.md` in the workspace root; component repos should link
to it from their docs index. Deployment-specific topology lives in
`acornops-deployment/docs/deployment-architecture.md`.

## Shared skills

Shared skills are synced into:

```text
.agents/skills/shared
```

Repo-specific skills stay in:

```text
.agents/skills/local
```

Shared skills are synced with `rsync --delete` only inside the shared skills
directory. Do not place repo-owned skills or custom files under
`.agents/skills/shared`.

The sync writes `.agents/skills/shared/.standards-version` so a product repo can
see which standards revision last populated shared skills.

## Shared GitHub templates

Workspace-owned pull request and issue templates live in the parent repository
under:

```text
.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
```

Sync them into child repositories with:

```bash
./scripts/sync/github-templates.sh --dry-run
./scripts/sync/github-templates.sh
```

The GitHub template sync copies only allowlisted template files. It does not
sync `.github/workflows`, delete child-owned `.github` files, or replace
repository-specific automation. Shared issue templates do not set default
labels or assignees; those are repository-specific GitHub settings.

## Template adoption

Use `templates/repository/` when bootstrapping or improving a repository harness.
Copy missing files, then replace placeholders with concrete repository facts.

Do not use templates as live includes. A product repository should continue to
work when checked out alone.

## Validation strategy

Every repository should expose one obvious validation command:

- JavaScript/TypeScript: usually `npm run validate`
- Python service: usually `task validate`
- Deployment/integration: usually `task validate`

That command should run the repository's local checks only. Cross-repo checks
belong in the deployment or platform harness.

Unit tests, integration tests, contract checks, smoke tests, and CI gates are
part of the harness. Markdown files define when each validation depth is
required; scripts, task runners, package commands, and CI enforce the rule.
Agents must include exact validation evidence before handoff.

Documentation is also part of the harness. Changes to features, APIs,
configuration, deployment behavior, operations, security, or reliability should
update the nearest durable doc in the same change. If no docs change is needed,
the handoff should include `Docs impact: none` with the reason.

## Reconciling shared and local checks

Shared standards define shape and expectations:

- docs must exist
- development and operations guides must be present
- contracts must be documented
- high-risk areas must be listed
- shared skills must follow metadata rules
- validation must be explicit
- handoff evidence must name exact commands and outcomes
- commit and pull request title guidance should be discoverable

Local repositories define substance:

- exact build/test/lint commands
- exact handoff and validation commands
- architecture boundaries
- service-specific contract checks
- development and operations details
- UI smoke tests
- migration and rollout checks
- domain-specific security rules

If shared and local guidance conflict, repo-local `AGENTS.md` wins for that
repository. Update this workspace repository only when the conflict reveals a
better organization-wide rule.

## Recommended update flow

1. Update shared skills, GitHub templates, or repository templates here.
2. Run `./scripts/harness/check-agent-harness.sh`.
3. Sync shared skills with `./scripts/sync/shared-skills.sh` when needed.
4. Sync GitHub templates with `./scripts/sync/github-templates.sh` when needed.
5. In each affected product repo, review generated diffs.
6. Run that repo's local validation command.
7. Commit product repo changes separately.

## What not to centralize

Do not centralize:

- service architecture docs
- contract manifests owned by product repos
- CI workflows that need repository secrets or runtime assumptions
- local skills
- local validation scripts
- product decisions and UX rules

Also do not centralize vendor-specific agent instruction files. `AGENTS.md`
stays the generic repository entrypoint.

Centralizing these would make standalone repositories less legible to agents and
reviewers.
