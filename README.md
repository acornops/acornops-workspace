  Versioned workspace harness for AcornOps multi-repository development.
</p>

This repository is the developer entry point for working across AcornOps
repositories. It owns the workspace manifest, setup and validation helpers,
shared repository templates, shared GitHub templates, and cross-repository
documentation. It does not own product source code. Product repositories are
checked out as ignored child directories and remain independently versioned.

## Workspace Model

AcornOps uses three layers:

1. Workspace harness in this repository.
2. Repo-local harnesses committed to each standalone product repository.
3. Platform and integration checks that validate cross-repository contracts.

Start here when setting up the workspace, checking repository status, or running
cross-repository validation. Agent-specific operating rules live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); `CLAUDE.md` imports that same file so agent-facing
instructions stay in one place.

## Agent-Assisted Development

This workspace is structured for human and agent-assisted development. When
using Codex, Claude Code, or another coding agent, start the agent from the
workspace root for best results. The root contains the workspace manifest,
shared agent guidance, validation helpers, and cross-repository workflow rules
that help agents coordinate changes across child repositories.

For single-repository work, agents should still read that child repository's
`AGENTS.md` before editing files there.

## What Belongs Here

- workspace setup and validation helpers
- shared agent skills used across AcornOps repositories
- workspace manifest and repository capability summary
- repository harness templates
- synchronization tooling for shared skills and GitHub templates
- cross-repository harness and contract checks
- vendor-neutral handoff and Conventional Commit policy

## What Stays In Each Product Repo

- service source code and tests
- repo-specific `AGENTS.md`
- architecture and product docs
- contract manifests owned by that repo
- validation commands and CI workflows
- repo-specific local skills under `.agents/skills/local`
- service-specific runbooks, migrations, and rollout notes
- repository-specific labels and GitHub workflow secrets

Child repositories are intentionally ignored by this parent repository. Do not
stage or commit product repository contents from the workspace repo.

## Getting Started

Clone the workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acornops/acornops-workspace.git acornops
cd acornops
```

Set up the workspace:

```bash
task setup
```

`task setup` clones missing child repositories from `workspace.yaml` over HTTPS,
normalizes existing matching GitHub remotes to the workspace manifest, and then
checks local tools, child repository remotes, and workspace status.

Understand the platform:

- [System Architecture](docs/system-architecture.md) explains how the AcornOps
  components, runtime flows, and repository ownership fit together.
- [`workspace.yaml`](workspace.yaml) lists every child repository, local path,
  remote, default branch, and validation command.

Preview clone actions before running setup:

```bash
task workspace:bootstrap -- --dry-run
```

If Task is not installed yet, use the underlying scripts directly:

```bash
./scripts/workspace/bootstrap.mjs
./scripts/workspace/doctor.mjs
```

Dependency installation and service startup stay repo-local because each product
repo owns its own runtime. After bootstrap, read the affected child repo's
README and validation command in `workspace.yaml`.

More detail: [Developer Getting Started](docs/developer-getting-started.md).

## Daily Maintenance

Inspect parent and child repository status:

```bash
task workspace:status
```

Fetch remote refs without changing local branches:

```bash
task workspace:fetch
```

Fast-forward only clean repositories on their default branch:

```bash
task workspace:update
```

`task workspace:update` skips repositories with local changes, repositories on
non-default branches, branches with unpushed commits, and divergent histories.

## Validate

```bash
task validate
```

`task validate` runs the workspace harness, recent commit subject validation,
child repository harness checks, and cross-repository contract checks. The
underlying commands are:

```bash
./scripts/harness/check-agent-harness.sh
node scripts/harness/check-conventional-commits.mjs --last 1
node scripts/harness/check-platform-harness.mjs
node scripts/harness/check-platform-contracts.mjs
```

Commit subjects and pull request titles must follow
[Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
See [Conventional Commits](docs/agent-harness/conventional-commits.md).

## Coordinated Changes

For changes that touch more than one product repository:

- identify the affected repositories from `workspace.yaml`
- keep product code changes inside the child repositories
- record coordinated work in `change-sets/` when the work spans repos
- run each affected repo's validation plus workspace/platform checks
- link related PRs and include merge order when changes depend on each other

Agent-facing workflow details and helper-script usage belong in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the shared skill workflow, not in this developer
README.

More detail:

- [Change Sets](change-sets/README.md)
- [Repository Capability Summary](docs/agent-harness/repository-capability-summary.md)
- [Agent Handoff Policy](docs/agent-harness/agent-handoff-policy.md)
- [Docs Maintenance](docs/agent-harness/docs-maintenance.md)
- [Cross-Repo Skill Workflow](.agents/skills/shared/cross-repo-change/workflow.md)

## Shared Skills

Shared skills are maintained in this workspace and synced into child
repositories when the shared agent guidance changes.

Preview changes first:

```bash
./scripts/sync/shared-skills.sh --dry-run
```

Apply intentionally:

```bash
./scripts/sync/shared-skills.sh
```

The sync command updates only `.agents/skills/shared` and `.agents/skills/README.md`
inside configured child repositories. It never overwrites
`.agents/skills/local`.

The parent workspace does not keep a `.agents/skills/local` directory. Workspace
skills are shared by default; child repositories keep their own local skills.

## Claude Settings

The shared `.claude/settings.json` is maintained in this workspace and synced
into child repositories when it changes:

```bash
./scripts/sync/claude-settings.sh --dry-run
./scripts/sync/claude-settings.sh
```

The sync copies only `.claude/settings.json`. It never syncs the machine-specific
`.claude/settings.local.json`, and never deletes child-owned `.claude` files.

## GitHub Templates

Workspace-owned pull request and issue templates live under `.github/` so the
parent repository can use them directly. They can also be synced into configured
child repositories:

```bash
./scripts/sync/github-templates.sh --dry-run
./scripts/sync/github-templates.sh
```

The GitHub template sync copies only allowlisted issue and pull request template
files. It does not touch child repository workflows or delete child-owned
`.github` files. Shared issue templates intentionally do not set default labels;
labels are repository-specific and should be configured inside each child
repository when needed.
